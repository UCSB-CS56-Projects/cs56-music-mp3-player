## Oscar-Loza Corona and Matthew Rodriguez
**(a)**
... A basic music mp3 player that displays files. It does not actually play the files.
**(b)**
... As a user, I can run the program to view the files that the player deems playable. As a user, I can interact with the buttons displayed in the GUI, but there is no response. As a user, I can write text into the name, artist, and genre columns, but that text is not saved.
**(c)**
... The software does run. It its current state, it displays 3 buttons at the top of the GUI, and below those buttons it displays a 5 by 3 table, with its first row labeled as name, artist, and genre. Each column corresponds to one of those categories.
**(d)**
... As a user, I could interact with the play button of the GUI to play the currently selected song. As a user, I could skip a song or go to the previous song played. As a user, I could create a playlist of songs for future reference. As a user, I can alter what information is displayed about the song (ex. time, artist, but not genre).
**(e)**
... The README.md file could have had links that point towards the research that the previous generation of programmers did to this project. There could have been brief descriptions of each source code file.
**(f)**
... The current state of the build.xml is functional.
**(g)**
... There are not enough issues for the 1000 points, but the project has a lot of room for improvement. The current issues are clear in what they expect.
**(h)**
... No additional issues have been added.
**(i)**
... The actual code is designed with object orientation in mind. The functions of the program are seperately defined in a different file, while the actual GUI building code is in a seperate file. If we had to give someone else that was going to work on the code just "one screenful of text', we'd show them the play, previous, and next functions that control the song flow.
**(j)**
... Test coverage is minimal, there is only one jUnit test.
